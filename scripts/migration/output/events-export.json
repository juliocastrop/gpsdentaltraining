Restorative dentists and surgeons are encouraged to attend this course with their assistants, hygienists, laboratory technicians, and treatment coordinators. At the conclusion of this two-day course, the entire dental team will have gained an understanding of the major components that make up a successful private practice.<br />\nThrough a carefully designed curriculum with exciting hands-on workstations, all critical steps for a digital workflow will be explained in detail for each team member. Every participant will receive one-on-one hands-on instructions in a clinical setting utilizing the latest educational mannequins available. In addition, participants will experience intraoral scanning, smile design, face scanning, CBCT acquisition, presurgical and restorative planning, prosthetic designing, 3D printing, and milling of surgical guides, provisionals, and definitive prostheses.<br />\nTo further the educational experience, this course will focus on five clinical scenarios:</p>\n<p>1.

      "courseDescription": "This lecture and hands-on course is designed to teach the entire dental team how to integrate a digital workflow into a dental office. Restorative dentists and surgeons are encouraged to attend this course with their assistants, hygienists, laboratory technicians, and treatment coordinators. At the conclusion of this two-day course, the entire dental team will have gained an understanding of the major components that make up a successful private practice.\r\nThrough a carefully designed curriculum with exciting hands-on workstations, all critical steps for a digital workflow will be explained in detail for each team member. Every participant will receive one-on-one hands-on instructions in a clinical setting utilizing the latest educational mannequins available. In addition, participants will experience intraoral scanning, smile design, face scanning, CBCT acquisition, presurgical and restorative planning, prosthetic designing, 3D printing, and milling of surgical guides, provisionals, and definitive prostheses.\r\nTo further the educational experience, this course will focus on five clinical scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. Restorative dentistry on natural teeth\r\n2. Single tooth implant restorations\r\n3. Partially edentulous implant restorations\r\n4. Fully edentulous implant restorations\r\n5. Adjunct services (nightguards, whitening, and sleep apnea devices)\r\n\r\nIn addition, there will be multiple elective presentations available on information technology (IT), return on investment (ROI), 3D printing, smile design, financing options, office design, and surgical planning on both days.\r\n\r\nIf you are planning on incorporating a digital workflow or simply purchasing any digital technology for your practice, this course will prepare you for the journey",

However, there is ongoing debate regarding effective therapies to reduce bone loss around dental implants placed immediately after extraction. Digital dentistry has emerged as a promising approach for improving treatment time efficiency and promoting positive biological outcomes. This course aims to review the current literature on immediate implant placement and discuss the biological principles of an accelerated restorative protocol. It will also explore the impact of digitally designed and fabricated restorations on the development of healthy peri-implant tissues and provide a step-by-step protocol for immediate implant placement and restoration in just two visits. This course will guide you in solving controversial topics like: When to extract or when to save, Graft or not graft.</p>\n                            <h3>Immediate Implant Placement</h3>\n                                General                            \n                            <bdi>&#36;2,500.00</bdi>                        \n                                                    <!-- Tickets Available -->\n                                    <label>Qty:</label>\n                                    <input type=\"number\" min=\"1\" max=\"10\" value=\"1\">\n                                                                <button data-product-id=\"9010\">\n                                    Add to Cart                                </button>\n                                10 tickets remaining                            \n        <style>\n        /* Sold Out Card Styling */\n        .gps-ticket-sold-out {\n            background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f8f9fa 0%, #e9ecef 100%);\n            border: 2px dashed #dee2e6;\n            border-radius: 12px;\n            padding: 30px;\n            text-align: center;\n            margin-top: 20px;\n        }\n        .gps-sold-out-badge {\n            display: inline-flex;\n            align-items: center;\n            gap: 8px;\n            background: #fff3cd;\n            color: #856404;\n            padding: 8px 16px;\n            border-radius: 20px;\n            font-weight: 600;\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n            border: 1px solid #ffc107;\n        }\n        .gps-sold-out-icon {\n            font-size: 20px;\n        }\n        .gps-sold-out-message {\n            margin: 20px 0;\n        }\n        .gps-sold-out-message p {\n            margin: 10px 0;\n            color: #495057;\n            line-height: 1.6;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-cta {\n            font-weight: 600;\n            color: #212529;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-form {\n            margin-top: 20px;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-fields {\n            display: flex;\n            gap: 10px;\n            max-width: 400px;\n            margin: 0 auto;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-input {\n            flex: 1;\n            padding: 12px 16px;\n            border: 2px solid #ced4da;\n            border-radius: 8px;\n            font-size: 14px;\n            transition: border-color 0.3s;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-input:focus {\n            outline: none;\n            border-color: #0d6efd;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-submit {\n            padding: 12px 24px;\n            background: #0d6efd;\n            color: white;\n            border: none;\n            border-radius: 8px;\n            font-weight: 600;\n            cursor: pointer;\n            transition: background 0.3s;\n            white-space: nowrap;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-submit:hover {\n            background: #0b5ed7;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-submit:disabled {\n            background: #6c757d;\n            cursor: not-allowed;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-response {\n            margin-top: 15px;\n            padding: 12px;\n            border-radius: 8px;\n            font-size: 14px;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-response.success {\n            background: #d1e7dd;\n            color: #0f5132;\n            border: 1px solid #badbcc;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-response.error {\n            background: #f8d7da;\n            color: #842029;\n            border: 1px solid #f5c2c7;\n        }\n        /* Table Sold Out Styling */\n        .gps-sold-out-badge-small {\n            display: inline-block;\n            background: #fff3cd;\n            color: #856404;\n            padding: 4px 8px;\n            border-radius: 4px;\n            font-size: 11px;\n            font-weight: 600;\n            margin-left: 8px;\n            border: 1px solid #ffc107;\n        }\n        .gps-sold-out-row {\n            opacity: 0.7;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-btn-table {\n            padding: 8px 16px;\n            background: #6c757d;\n            color: white;\n            border: none;\n            border-radius: 6px;\n            font-size: 14px;\n            cursor: pointer;\n            transition: background 0.3s;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-btn-table:hover {\n            background: #5c636a;\n        }\n        </style>\n            <button\n                    data-title=\"Immediate Implant Placement: From A to Z Master Hands-On Course\"\n                    data-description=\"May 15 &#8211;

      "courseDescription": "Immediate implant placement on fresh sockets and Implant-supported restorations have become increasingly prevalent in implant dentistry. However, there is ongoing debate regarding effective therapies to reduce bone loss around dental implants placed immediately after extraction. Digital dentistry has emerged as a promising approach for improving treatment time efficiency and promoting positive biological outcomes. This course aims to review the current literature on immediate implant placement and discuss the biological principles of an accelerated restorative protocol. It will also explore the impact of digitally designed and fabricated restorations on the development of healthy peri-implant tissues and provide a step-by-step protocol for immediate implant placement and restoration in just two visits. This course will guide you in solving controversial topics like: When to extract or when to save, Graft or not graft.",

However, there is ongoing debate regarding effective therapies to reduce bone loss around dental implants placed immediately after extraction. Digital dentistry has emerged as a promising approach for improving treatment time efficiency and promoting positive biological outcomes. This course aims to review the current literature on immediate implant placement and discuss the biological principles of an accelerated restorative protocol. It will also explore the impact of digitally designed and fabricated restorations on the development of healthy peri-implant tissues and provide a step-by-step protocol for immediate implant placement and restoration in just two visits. This course will guide you in solving controversial topics like: When to extract or when to save, Graft or not graft.</p>\n                            <h3>Immediate Implant Placement</h3>\n                                General                            \n                            <bdi>&#36;2,500.00</bdi>                        \n                                                    <!-- Tickets Available -->\n                                    <label>Qty:</label>\n                                    <input type=\"number\" min=\"1\" max=\"10\" value=\"1\">\n                                                                <button data-product-id=\"9010\">\n                                    Add to Cart                                </button>\n                                10 tickets remaining                            \n        <style>\n        /* Sold Out Card Styling */\n        .gps-ticket-sold-out {\n            background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f8f9fa 0%, #e9ecef 100%);\n            border: 2px dashed #dee2e6;\n            border-radius: 12px;\n            padding: 30px;\n            text-align: center;\n            margin-top: 20px;\n        }\n        .gps-sold-out-badge {\n            display: inline-flex;\n            align-items: center;\n            gap: 8px;\n            background: #fff3cd;\n            color: #856404;\n            padding: 8px 16px;\n            border-radius: 20px;\n            font-weight: 600;\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n            border: 1px solid #ffc107;\n        }\n        .gps-sold-out-icon {\n            font-size: 20px;\n        }\n        .gps-sold-out-message {\n            margin: 20px 0;\n        }\n        .gps-sold-out-message p {\n            margin: 10px 0;\n            color: #495057;\n            line-height: 1.6;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-cta {\n            font-weight: 600;\n            color: #212529;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-form {\n            margin-top: 20px;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-fields {\n            display: flex;\n            gap: 10px;\n            max-width: 400px;\n            margin: 0 auto;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-input {\n            flex: 1;\n            padding: 12px 16px;\n            border: 2px solid #ced4da;\n            border-radius: 8px;\n            font-size: 14px;\n            transition: border-color 0.3s;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-input:focus {\n            outline: none;\n            border-color: #0d6efd;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-submit {\n            padding: 12px 24px;\n            background: #0d6efd;\n            color: white;\n            border: none;\n            border-radius: 8px;\n            font-weight: 600;\n            cursor: pointer;\n            transition: background 0.3s;\n            white-space: nowrap;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-submit:hover {\n            background: #0b5ed7;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-submit:disabled {\n            background: #6c757d;\n            cursor: not-allowed;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-response {\n            margin-top: 15px;\n            padding: 12px;\n            border-radius: 8px;\n            font-size: 14px;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-response.success {\n            background: #d1e7dd;\n            color: #0f5132;\n            border: 1px solid #badbcc;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-response.error {\n            background: #f8d7da;\n            color: #842029;\n            border: 1px solid #f5c2c7;\n        }\n        /* Table Sold Out Styling */\n        .gps-sold-out-badge-small {\n            display: inline-block;\n            background: #fff3cd;\n            color: #856404;\n            padding: 4px 8px;\n            border-radius: 4px;\n            font-size: 11px;\n            font-weight: 600;\n            margin-left: 8px;\n            border: 1px solid #ffc107;\n        }\n        .gps-sold-out-row {\n            opacity: 0.7;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-btn-table {\n            padding: 8px 16px;\n            background: #6c757d;\n            color: white;\n            border: none;\n            border-radius: 6px;\n            font-size: 14px;\n            cursor: pointer;\n            transition: background 0.3s;\n        }\n        .gps-waitlist-btn-table:hover {\n            background: #5c636a;\n        }\n        </style>\n            <button\n                    data-title=\"Mastering Large Case Acceptance\"\n                    data-description=\"Aug 14, 2026 CE Credits: 10 Clinical and Business Strategies for FFS Practice Growth Register Share This Course &times;

You’ll review clot biology, growth-factor release kinetics, and how centrifugation settings influence fibrin architecture. Through step-by-step labs, participants prepare A-PRF / S-PRF, fabricate membranes/plugs, and practice combination techniques (e.g., “sticky bone” with particulate grafts)<br />\nClinical modules cover:<br />\n● Extraction &amp; ridge preservation with PRF membranes and plugs<br />\n● Immediate implant protocols (primary stability, gap management)<br />\n● Sinus augmentation (lateral and crestal approaches with PRF adjuncts)<br />\n● Soft-tissue management (healing optimization, dehiscence mitigation)<br />\n● Documentation/consent &amp; patient communication for biologics</p>\n

You’ll review clot biology, growth-factor release kinetics, and how centrifugation settings influence fibrin architecture. Through step-by-step labs, participants prepare A-PRF / S-PRF, fabricate membranes/plugs, and practice combination techniques (e.g., “sticky bone” with particulate grafts)\r\nClinical modules cover: \r\n● Extraction & ridge preservation with PRF membranes and plugs \r\n● Immediate implant protocols (primary stability, gap management) \r\n● Sinus augmentation (lateral and crestal approaches with PRF adjuncts) \r\n● Soft-tissue management (healing optimization, dehiscence mitigation) \r\n● Documentation/consent & patient communication for biologics",
